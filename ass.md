1. What is Cloud?
Ans:- cloud computing is type of services(resources like virtual machine,storage,computing,database,monitoring tool) provide by vendor on demand.
Amazon Web Services(AWS) ,Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

2. Types of Cloud?
There are 4 types of Cloud:
	1. Public Cloud
	2. Private Cloud
	3. Hybrid Cloud
	4. Community Cloud
	
1. Public Cloud:- Public cloud is open to all to store and access information via the Internet using the pay-per-usage method. In public cloud, computing resources are managed and operated by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
Example: Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2), IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, Microsoft, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Services Platform.
Advantages of Public Cloud:-
There are the following advantages of Public Cloud -
	1. Public cloud is owned at a lower cost than the private and hybrid cloud.
	2. Public cloud is maintained by the cloud service provider, so do not need to worry about the maintenance.
	3. Public cloud is easier to integrate. Hence it offers a better flexibility approach to consumers.
	4. Public cloud is location independent because its services are delivered through the internet.
	5. Public cloud is highly scalable as per the requirement of computing resources.
	6. It is accessible by the general public, so there is no limit to the number of users.
Disadvantages of Public Cloud
	1. Public Cloud is less secure because resources are shared publicly.
	2. Performance depends upon the high-speed internet network link to the cloud provider.
	3. The Client has no control of data.
Private Cloud
	Private cloud is also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud. It is used by organizations to build and manage their own data centers internally or by the third party. It can be deployed using Open source tools such as Open stack and Eucalyptus. Based on the location and management, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) divide private cloud into the following two parts-
		1. On-premise private cloud
		2. Outsourced private cloud
Advantages of Private Cloud
There are the following advantages of the Private Cloud -
	1. Private cloud provides a high level of security and privacy to the users.
	2. Private cloud offers better performance with improved speed and space capacity.
	3. It allows the IT team to quickly allocate and deliver on-demand IT resources.
	4. The organization has full control over the cloud because it is managed by the organization itself. So, there is no need for the organization to depends on anybody.
	5. It is suitable for organizations that require a separate cloud for their personal use and data security is the first priority.
Disadvantages of Private Cloud
	1. Skilled people are required to manage and operate cloud services.
	2. Private cloud is accessible within the organization, so the area of operations is limited.
	3. Private cloud is not suitable for organizations that have a high user base, and organizations that do not have the prebuilt infrastructure, sufficient manpower to maintain and manage the cloud.
	3. Hybrid Cloud
	Hybrid Cloud is a combination of the public cloud and the private cloud. we can say:
		Hybrid Cloud = Public Cloud + Private Cloud
	
Q3. Advantage of Cloud computing.
 	1.pay as you go(as per use of cloud you have to pay money)
      	2.it is less cost cansuming than traditional computing.
	3.it is more flexible 
	4.it is 24*7 available:you can access at anytime Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

4. What is EC2?
	EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
	It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazonâ€™s proven computing environment.
	we can use scale up and scale down (for the ram rom  other resources)as per requirement.

5. Difference between Server & cloud?
	The Cloud Server is a virtual server that offers high scalability in addition to dedicated resources.
	This server is well suited for both simple and highly complex projects. You can adjust the available resources at any time. 
	These resources are billed to the minute. You have access to a range of functions,
	for example the ability to create images that you can use to recover the server or create additional Cloud Servers, 
	or the option to create private networks to divide your existing network into multiple logical subnetworks.

	The Dedicated Server is a physical server with dedicated hardware. The available resources are not shared with other customers.
	All of the hardware resources are available to you. Any sensitive data on these servers is therefore extremely well protected.
